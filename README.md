# Place for vendor tarballs

As Golangs dependency system is completely bonkers and Gentoo doesn't really have a good way to deal with that, it generally requires separate vendor tarballs if the Go package doesn't have a vendor directory itself. This repo is meant to store vendor tarballs so they can be used in the [`third-party-certbot-plugins`](https://github.com/osirisinferi/third-party-certbot-plugins) Gentoo overlay.
